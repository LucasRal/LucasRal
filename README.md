- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucas RALAMBO

- 👀 I’m interested in everything around tech in general. But mostly passionated about implementing and 
  applying Machine Learning algorithms to any kind of fields (Finance, Marketing, Social media...).
  In fact, I do enjoy experimenting myself with different Machine Learning methods such as NLP and CV.
  And my best part is when I dive deeper and try to understand the very fundamental concept of a model. Besides, I've always been in love with Maths and Stats.
  I feel even more confident about my skills when I get the point of when to actually use a learning model over an alternative one given any constraints.
  

- 🌱 I have recently been learning and continue to learn Big Data processing (The apache hadoop ecosystem) and advanced Deep Learning algorithms (CNN's, RNN's...) gradually.
   Currently, I am an intern Data Engineer in an "IT industry of an international group".

- 💞️ I’m open to any projects relative to data science and Machine Learning.
